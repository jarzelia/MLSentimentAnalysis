All code is done in python and requires the data inside of the main directory.  lrMain.py contains hard coded file-paths 
that point to the training and test data, so those need to match.

###Instructions:
```
// Install libraries
sudo pip install ... 

// Run from lrMain.py
python lrMain.py
```
###Libraries:
bs4, numpy, scipy, pandas, sklearn
